## A place name generator
Based pretty closely on [this Keras example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/fd3ac2a93ea2584d0679e27a10ebeff0508d7a37/examples/lstm_text_generation.py)

## Some favourites so far
- Sowton Porkham
- Diphead
- Ancestor
- Little Worth
- Long Mill on the Hill
- Bridge of Little Stratch Hill

## Technologies used
